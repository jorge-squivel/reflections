What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	You need it so you can store the files inthere.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It kind of process or prepares the files that will be included in a commit.

I'M STILL FUNCKING DOING IT, and you fucking bitches can go atraight to fucking hell. MOTHERFUCKERS.
